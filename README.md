### Simple Rest API using Golang

This project is a simple REST API built using Golang. I created it while following the [Go - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-guide/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) Udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

In this project, I learned how to build a RESTful API in Go, covering key backend development concepts such as:

- Fundamentals of Golang
- Handling HTTP Requests
- Routing
- Middleware
- Database Integration
- Authentication
- Authorization
